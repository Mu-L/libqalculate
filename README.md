# libqalculate
Qalculate! library and CLI

![Image of qalc](http://qalculate.github.io/images/qalc.png)

Qalculate! is a multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator. It is simple to use but provides power and versatility normally reserved for complicated math packages, as well as useful tools for everyday needs (such as currency conversion and percent calculation). Features include a large library of customizable functions, unit calculations and conversion, symbolic calculations (including integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation, interval arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface (GTK+, Qt, and CLI).

> [!TIP]
> Visit the website at https://qalculate.github.io/ to see additional screenshots, read the manual, and download the latest version.

## Requirements
* GMP and MPFR
* libxml2
* libcurl, icu, gettext (recommended)
* iconv, readline (recommended for CLI)
* Gnuplot (optional)
* doxygen (optional)

For Linux distributions which provide separate development packages, these must be installed for all the required libraries (e.g. libmpfr-dev) before compilation.

## Installation
Instructions and download links for installers, binaries packages, and the source code of released versions of Qalculate! are available at https://qalculate.github.io/downloads.html.

In a terminal window in the top source code directory run
* `./autogen.sh` *(not required if using a release source tarball, only if using the git version)*
* `./configure`
* `make`
* `make install` *(as root, e.g. `sudo make install`)*
* `ldconfig` *(if necessary, as root)*

If libqalculate is installed in /usr/local (default) you may need to add /usr/local/lib to the library path of the system (add /usr/local/lib to a file under /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and run ldconfig).

## API Documentation
The API documentation is included in the package and is installed in $docdir/libqalculate/html (usually /usr/share/doc/libqalculate/html). It is generated when running autogen.sh.

It is also available online at http://qalculate.github.io/reference/index.html.

## Using the CLI program 'qalc'
To calculate a single expression from the command line (non-interactive mode) enter
`qalc mathematical expression` *(e.g. qalc 5+2)*

`qalc --help` shows information about command line options in non-interactive mode.

If you run `qalc` without any mathematical expression the program will start in interactive mode, where you can enter multiple expressions with history and completion, manipulate the result and change settings. Type `help` in interactive mode for more information.

A man page is also available (shown using the command `man qalc`, or online at https://qalculate.github.io/manual/qalc.html).
